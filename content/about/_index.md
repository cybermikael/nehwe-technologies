# About Me

I help small federal contractors prepare for **CMMC** and **NIST 800-171** requirements without the cost and complexity of hiring a full-time cybersecurity team.

## Real-World Federal Experience

I've worked in federal environments supporting **Air Force contracts** and understand the real-world side of compliance:  

- Gap assessments  
- POA&Ms (Plans of Action & Milestones)  
- Documentation  
- Practical risk reduction — not theory

---

## My Approach

My focus is on helping leadership:

- Understand where they currently stand  
- Identify what actually matters for compliance  
- Move forward with a clear remediation plan

## Helping You Move Forward

If **CMMC** or **NIST requirements** are slowing contracts, creating uncertainty, or causing stress, I offer a **fixed-price readiness assessment** to bring clarity and actionable next steps.
