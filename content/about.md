## Helping Federal Contractors Navigate Compliance With Clarity

I help small and mid-sized federal contractors understand, prepare for, and meet **NIST 800-171 and CMMC requirements**—without unnecessary complexity, fear-driven consulting, or over-engineered solutions.

Compliance work does not need to be disruptive or confusing. With the right structure and guidance, it becomes manageable, predictable, and defensible.

## Relevant Experience That Matters

I am a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience supporting **U.S. Space Force federal contracts**, where compliance, documentation, and risk management are core operational requirements—not afterthoughts.

My background includes:
- Assessing security controls in regulated environments  
- Identifying compliance gaps aligned with NIST frameworks  
- Supporting remediation planning and POA&M development  
- Working in environments where audit readiness is expected at all times  

This experience allows me to approach compliance from a **practical, real-world perspective**, not theory.

## A Practical, No-Noise Approach to Compliance

Most contractors do not need more tools or abstract advice.  
They need **clarity, prioritization, and documentation that holds up under scrutiny**.

My approach focuses on:
- Clear, control-by-control gap analysis  
- Practical Plans of Action & Milestones (POA&Ms)  
- Realistic timelines based on business constraints  
- Documentation that reflects how your organization actually operates  

The goal is not perfection—it is **audit-ready, defensible compliance**.

## Who This Is For

This approach is designed for organizations that:
- Are federal contractors or subcontractors  
- Have between 5 and 100 employees  
- Are preparing for NIST 800-171 or CMMC assessments  
- Do not have a full-time internal security or compliance team  

If that sounds like your organization, you are in the right place.

## Why Clients Work With Me

Compliance can feel overwhelming when expectations are unclear or guidance is inconsistent. My role is to remove that uncertainty by providing a **structured process**, clear deliverables, and calm, professional guidance throughout the engagement.

If you need to understand where you stand—and what to do next—I can help.
