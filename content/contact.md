## Who I Help

I help small and mid-sized federal contractors understand, prepare for, and achieve compliance with NIST 800-171 and CMMC requirements—without unnecessary complexity or fear-driven consulting.

## My Background

I am a former cybersecurity analyst supporting a U.S. Air Force federal contract, with hands-on experience assessing security controls, identifying gaps, and supporting compliance-driven environments.

I specialize in practical, actionable compliance—not theory.

## My Approach

Most contractors don’t need more tools.
They need clarity.

I focus on:
- Clear gap analysis
- Practical remediation plans (POA&Ms)
- Realistic timelines and priorities
- Documentation that actually reflects how your business operates

## Who This Is For

- Defense contractors and subcontractors
- Small businesses pursuing DoD contracts
- Organizations preparing for CMMC or NIST 800-171 assessments

If that’s you, you’re in the right place.
